# ðŸŒ¿ Cotton Disease Prediction using Deep Learning

This project focuses on predicting cotton plant diseases using advanced Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and **transfer learning** techniques. Pre-trained models like **ResNet50**, **InceptionV3**, and **ResNet152V2** have been fine-tuned for accurate classification of healthy vs. diseased cotton leaves.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

Cotton crop diseases can severely affect yield and productivity. With the help of image classification using deep learning, early detection and classification of diseases becomes faster and more accurate. This project uses **transfer learning** to leverage powerful pre-trained models for efficient classification.
